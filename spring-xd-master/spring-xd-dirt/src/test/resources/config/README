These fake module files are used in ResourceModuleRegistryTests. Do NOT modify
or repurpose them for other tests. Instead, create your own module root
that you can easily interpret as a registry thanks to ResourceModuleRegistry.
Note that the exact combination of overlapping file names (e.g. file-test) is
important to the above tests.
